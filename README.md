## Abstract

Dementia patients may present with different symptoms, progress at different rates at different stages of the disease, and respond differently to interventions. Therefore, it is critical to understand the heterogeneous characteristics at different stages and develop an ability to reliably assess the dementia onset and progression. In this study, we confirmed the population-level progression rates and the heterogeneity of LATE progression, and then we developed a stage-stratified approach by leveraging machine learning to probabilistically estimate the time courses of LATE stage-specific progression for different individuals. Our study has the potential to provide an individualized assessment of future time to LATE disease conversions years before their actual occurrences.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.7.8

JupyterLab 3.2.9

## Datasets

Our approach of predictive modeling and analysis was established on the large prospective cohort, the National Alzheimers Coordinating Center (NACC) with subjects’ multiple-visit information between 2005 and 2020, which can be accessed upon request and approval by the data owner via the link https://naccdata.org/.
